# Game_Development
This silly game features Drake the Pop Star versus the Federal Government of Canada...in space. Written with the PyGame library, this game features collision detection, dynamic enemies, and sound effects! More projects to be added to this repository soon, as well as a official game I am developing and hoping to launch on Steam.
